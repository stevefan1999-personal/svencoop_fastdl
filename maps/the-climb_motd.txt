TheClimb!!

Make your way up the obstacle course, but be careful!
If you fall you will have to start all over.

Ported to Sven Co-op by Adam "Adambean" Reece

Originally a custom map for Team Fortress Classic available here:
https://gamebanana.com/maps/161015

Tips/notes:

* There are no checkpoints! If you fall off you have to climb back up.
* This is a pretty hard challenge, and will stress test your ability to manoeuvre in the GoldSrc/Svengine game engine. Expect your first attempt to take at least 1-2 hours. (Medium difficulty of the 3 maps.)
* Some of the longer jumps later on will require the strafe jumping technique.
* You may want (or ask the server owner) to enable Sven Co-op's Teleport plug-in so you can save your position by saying "/s", and restore it by saying "/p" when (not if) you fall.
* If you do use "/p" while falling you will still fall after restoring, thus you will likely be killed. Wait until you stop falling first.
* Fall damage is will hurt you badly. Please heal other players when they're hurt.
* Press +use (usually "E") to instantly stop moving when you land on something.
* Please be patient of players in front of you. This isn't a race, so don't try to push past causing others fall off.
* Although this map may seem impossible throughout it HAS been tested to completion by 3 people. It's just hard.

Differences from the original map:

* Medkits added at the very start so should you fall (and not die) you can begin again with full health. (Probably pointless.)
* The victory ball at the end will not slow you down like an anvil.
* The "power field" at the inaccessible very very top does nothing.

If you can beat this map (legitimately, no cheating, etc) you can call yourself pretty darn dexterous on this game engine. (You will also score 10 points for each completion.)
