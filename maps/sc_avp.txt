Welcome to Version 3 - Of the SC_AVP Mission set

You have made one of the best choices for a Sven Coop Map Pack Because -

1) Its made by a mapper that makes updates, and listens to what the community wants

2) Is always getting new maps added onto it, even though they take 6 months to come out

3) Is designed for Single Player, but is hard enough for it to still be played with mates

Notes -
This is the third, and final Version of SC_AVP, how ever becuase of the addation of maps over time, along with updates and fixes in older maps, this set has been consdiered, and rejected for inclusion in the Svencoop Distrabrution. And as such becuase of the size of the set now (85MB) Its better to download, and install this as a SvenCoop Addon Mod. If you how ever feel that this set SHOULD be part of Svencoop, please email Sniper sniper@svencoop.com, or Svenviking svenviking@svencoop.com

Version 3 had some changes to older maps, including

Some optomistion, and brush clean up in sc_avp2.
A big overhall of entitys, and such in sc_avp9, including the removel of the slot5 bug exploit, and the )-( wing button bug.
