        *** Black Mesa Accident + 19 hours ***

Slowly the army has taken control over nearly all parts of the
station. The survivors plan is to break through into an old
abandoned communication outpost, without getting the army's
attention. The situation looks even more desperate, because
their only hope lies on an old communication server, which
they will need to turn on again and send an emergency signal
to the outside world.
