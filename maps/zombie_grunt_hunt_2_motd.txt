zombie_grunt_hunt_2

Mission:
1-Find opening to "Devil's Rift".
2-Find and destroy ALL zombie grunts. 
3-Destroy any zombies you come in contact with. This isn't necessary but can 
be quite satisfying.
4-Find your way to the extraction point.



Mission brief:
Several squads of the clone experiments managed to escape destruction in your 
last mission. So now a team is being sent in to this location for eradication. 
This time we must get them all. 
Be careful! 
There have been reports of large dangerous insects inhabiting the caverns. 
The zombies have super strength and can kill you with one hit.

Hints:
Kill most of the grunts to start zombies spawning.
Kill most of the zombies to open grate to the canal below.
Crouch-jump down to water to escape injury.
