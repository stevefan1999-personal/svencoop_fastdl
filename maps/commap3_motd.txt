        *** Black Mesa Accident + 21 hours ***

The survivors of the Communications Array Onslaught
have escaped through a tunnel passage opened by the
explosion of the large communications computer. 
They have found themselves in the Sector H Parking
Garage located very close to the surface, but very
far from the outside world and its safety. Escaping
the Communications Tower was only a small portion
of the path that these strong-willed men and women
must walk to escape the bowels of the Black Mesa
Research Facility. Will they make it, who knows.
Their fates now lie in the comrades they have gained
through their adventures.
