Chapter 1: Trapped In A Nightmare

The strangest of events began to occur following the events of the resonance cascade at Black Mesa.
Scientists were slowly disappearing and the entire facility seemed to be falling to its knees.
A few scientists even went mad, destroying special equipment and harming other personnel.
At around 0200, a group of scientists were attacked by another group of researchers.
They were captured and brought to a laboratory, where the researchers conducted psychotic tests and
"unnecessary analysis" on them. The researchers threw the battered and beaten test subjects into a specimen 
treatment cell in the Cell Block Sector... and left them there to die. YOU are these test subjects. You have only
one objective, to escape from Black Mesa and regain your freedom! You must escape the Nightmare before you!

"...Will you escape?"


Details:

You must use teamwork to beat this map!
This comes in many forms from:

1) Ducking to boost another player to a high ledge
2) Holding a door open for another player
3) And many more!

Good luck!
