Story -

Well-done team!

Morning is coming quick, and that is when the militia will be at its strongest.

I have found out that DMC Squad was able to land there )-( wing, before they where lost.

The )-( wing is very close, though you have the jungle to battle first.

Scans show a Gargantuan is closed in a shed, and a group of militia are on there way to kill it, we have also found some more of these dog like Xenon as well

Objectives -
