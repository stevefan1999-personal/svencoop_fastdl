        *** Black Mesa Accident + 30 hours ***

Fighting through the sewers and office complexes
didn't leave the team without a scratch. Ammo
is running low, some teammates were severly injured.
Despite this their spirits were still up to fight
through whatever lies ahead of them.

The surroundings indicate that they were coming 
closer to the outskirts of the Black Mesa complex.
No-one of the former staff has ever imagined that 
it would be so big. Hopefully there is a way out at
the end of this all.
