        *** Black Mesa Accident + 15 hours ***

You and some of the other Black Mesa Staff have
survived the sudden accident that opened a 
portal to a alien world. Driven back by the
alien forces, they find themselves trapped in a 
sub-underground storage facility. With every alien
attack the survivers lose more ammo and some of
their friends. The survivors agree to take
their chances and break out of the facility. They
want to reach the surface as soon as possible,
not knowing that the military has already taken
control of a large part of the facility.
