Changes by Adambean for SC 4.7:

* Replaced all AAATRIGGER textures to NULL to improve rendering speed
* Fixed rendering glitch through the first door from the start
* Both batteries are now liftable to stop you getting them stuck
* Added small crates behind the generator so you can't get stuck there
* Re-built train so it doesn't segment when blocked, glass attached differently
