        *** Black Mesa Accident + 24 hours ***

Reaching the surface wasn't a ticket towards freedom,
the survivors of Black Mesa only got deeper into the
alien-infested or military controller area's. Black
Mesa has always been a classified government
project, there wasn't an easy way to get into it so
it didn't amaze the survivers that there wasn't an easy
way out either. The waiting is for a good opportunity
to either capture an enemy vehicle and get out of 
harms way for good. 

Before them lies a new complex, from wich they know
that it will hold many dangers. Although there is no
way around those, they have to fight through.
