SVENUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (LOL)
---------------------------------
 (Intentionally shitty PvP map)

OBJECTIVE:
- The Last Man Standing wins, stay alive and kill the others

HINTS:
- Every spawn gets a slow vehicle, 9 fast vehicles are available in the center of the map
- Be careful with vehicles, they can smash you to death while driving (drive responsibly)
- The moving walls are going to kill you, don't even try to get pushed by them
- You have 2 armor points while holding the frying pan (use to your advantage)
- Weapons deal way less damage than in normal Sven Co-op
- After ~3 minutes only a small area is available and the players HP get reduced by 1 every 3.75 sec until they are dead
- At the end you can choose to vote to play another round

SORRY:
- PvP in Sven Co-op only supports up to X players so it's limited, the remaining players can only observe (which is fun too)

Also the map creator never played PUBG.
