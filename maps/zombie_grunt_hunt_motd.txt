zombie_grunt_hunt

Mission:
1-Find and destroy ALL zombie grunts. If you miss even one the door will not 
open to next area.
2-Destroy any zombies you come in contact with. This isn't necessary but can 
be quite satisfying.




Mission brief:
Several squads of the clone experiments managed to escape destruction in your 
last mission. So now a team is being sent in to this location for eradication. 
This time we must get them all. 
Be careful! 
There have been reports of large dangerous insects inhabiting the caverns. 
The zombies have super strength and can kill you with one hit.

Hints:
The train is design to return if you fall off or are removed by the 
opposition.
Even at top speed the train can be jumped and control regained.
Shoot signs to open railway.
